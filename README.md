Common authentication logic for Blacklight and ArcLight patrons.

## Usage
This is an "unmounted" Rails engine. Models and actions are in the same scope as the host 
application it's integrated into.

### Configuration
This gem requires the following environment variables to be defined in the Blacklight/ArcLight host application:

* `DATABASE_URL` - Primary application database
* `PATRONS_DB_URL` - User and sessions database
* `GETALIBRARYCARD_BASE_URL` - Base URL of the Get A Library Card authentication endpoint
* `GETALIBRARYCARD_AUTH_PATH` - Path to the authentication endpoint
* `GETALIBRARYCARD_PATRON_DETAILS_PATH` - Path to the patron details endpoint
* `KEYCLOAK_CLIENT` - Keycloak client for staff login
* `KEYCLOAK_SECRET` - Keycloak client secret
* `KEYCLOAK_URL` - Keycloak OIDC authentication URL
* `KEYCLOAK_REALM` - Keycloak realm for catalogue

## Installation
Add this line to your host application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "catalogue-patrons", git: "https://github.com/nla/catalogue-patrons", tag: "[choose a tag]"
```
or to use the latest code on the `main` branch:

```ruby
gem "catalogue-patrons", git: "https://github.com/nla/catalogue-patrons"
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

### Configuration

Modify the host application's `config/database.yml` file to [support multiple databases](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_multiple_databases.html).
There is a `config/database.yml.sample` file that can be used as an example.

Mostly it involves redefining your main database connection as the "primary" in every environment
definition in the file, then adding a "patrons" connection to every environment.

### Migrations

Migrations need to be copied into the host application from this engine using the following command:

```bash
$ rails g catalogue:patrons:install
```

üö® This command needs to be performed whenever new migrations are added to this engine and will only
copy migrations which do not exist in the host application.

And then execute:
```bash
$ rails db:migrate
```

## Contributing
‚úèÔ∏è This repository uses [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org)
and commit messages are used to generate `CHANGELOG.md` and release body entries.

The most important prefixes you should have in mind are:

* `fix:` which represents bug fixes, and correlates to a SemVer patch.
* `feat:` which represents a new feature, and correlates to a SemVer minor.
* `feat!:`, or `fix!:`, `refactor!:`, etc., which represent a breaking change (indicated by the !) and will result in a SemVer major.

Releases are automated via GitHub workflows. See more in the ["Releases"](#releases) section below.

### Setup
`bin/setup` will configure Bundler to install gems into the `vendor/bundle` directory and install all dependencies.

üö® Installing gems into `vendor/bundle` serves to isolate the versions of gems used in this project from other Ruby projects on your development machine.

### Testing
There is a `bin/ci` script that will run specs, perform linting and security analysis.

There is a GitHub Actions workflow named `verify.yml` that lints and runs the RSpec test suite
whenever the following two events occur:
* A pull request that is targeted at the `main` branch is created or updated.
* Updates are commited against the `main` branch.

### Releases
Releases are automated via the `release.yml` GitHub workflow. This uses Google's
[release-please action](https://github.com/google-github-actions/release-please-action) to create pull
requests when changes are pushed to main. It will bump the version automatically and create a release
when the pull request is merged. Read more about how
[release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) works.

Pull requests merged to `main` will also trigger the `release.yml` workflow and update an existing 
release branch and pull-request.

üö® `CHANGELOG.md` is automatically created/updated for each release based on the commit messages.
